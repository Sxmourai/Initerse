# Introduction

This game is an automation game inspired by Vectorio, Factorio and my physics passions

## Lore

The goal of the game is to produce as much energy as possible, and not getting destroyed by shifters.

### Producing energy

When you start the game, you have an energy collector, which helps you collect energy from space's vacuum.
It's not very fast, but you need to start somewhere. Note that it also expels a bit of antimatter, but sends it very far, so it shouldn't be a problem.
With this energy (in the form of photons), we will want to make "matter", like atoms and other bigger elements.
You can make different machines for every fermions, and if you want to know more about any particle, check Wikipedia: [Fermions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermion)


### Monsters

The monsters are made of antimatter. They are pretty strong, because when they touch any of your infrastructure, both the monster and a part of your base explodes
