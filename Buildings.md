# First stage 
## Resource collectors

- Antimatter Dropoff: Scientists give you a lil bit of antimatter.

You have access to all crafters and turrets (if you can make them).

# Second stage

## Resource collectors

- You don't have the antimatter dropoff, but there are planets nearby.
- Matter collector: Collects matter and very carefully breaks them into pieces, reconstructing them as antimatter
More machines & info in ´Planetary drilling´

## Crafters

- String reshaper (fermion): Transforms antimatter into any antimatter fermion
- Baryonic combinator: Transforms quarks into baryons (protons and neutrons)
- Nucleus fusion reactor: Combines protons and neutrons into a nucleus, you need to quickly add some electrons to make a stable atom
- Ion fusion reactor: Combines a nucleus and electrons to make an atom or ion.


## Turrets

- Antimatter repeller: Creates a magnetic field to repulse near antimatter, costs 2 Iron and 100 Mev to operate.
- Antimatter missile: Creates repellers, put a drone on top, and sends them against ennemies, each missiles costs a fully charged repeller, so 2 Iron, 1 Lithium-ion and 1 Gev. Also costs 10 Mev passively (to check if ennemies are nearby)

# Planetary drilling
## Resource collectors

- Drill: Digs a hole in the planet, putting resources in it's back.
- Lift: Takes resources at point A and sends them up
- Item Drone: Transports items between point A to B (can follow a machine)
- Item pipe: Transfers items between machine A to B
- Unsorted item deposit: Fast to put stuff into, slow to get stuff out (yeah, gotta find what you need in this mess)
- Item deposit: Fast to input/output, but only stores 1 type of material.
- Melter: Melts a material, outputs a fluid pipe (needs to hold the temperature)
- Alloyer: Takes multiples fluids, outputs a single one
- Solidifier: Takes a molten fluid, cools it and outputs bars

## Item Drone modules
- Filter
### Upgrades
- Speed
- Capacity
- Energy consumption

# Star collector
2 resources are available near a star:
Energy: You can build a *Dyson sphere* to get huge amount of energy
Gases: You can extract resources from the star, like Hydrogen, Helium, Carbon ..., the hotter the star, the more complex the elements will be.

To collect resources you will need:
- Gas extractor: Extracts hot gas from plasma (no filter)
- Hot gas pipe
- Liquefier: Turns hot gaz into a pressurized liquid (costs no energy, uses the energy of hot gas)
- Space container shuttle tower: Provides functionnality to put items in shuttles, refill their fuel, ...
- Space container shuttle: Space version of Item drone, holds much more items, but has to do more distance.

But you can also use it as a big machine !
If you heat it up, you can make heavier materials (at an incredible rate): even Iron !
If you make it stop doing fusion, it will collapse into a *Neutron star* or a *Black hole*, which are also able to give you incredible resources

## Neutron star (mid-game)
Neutron stars holds resources like highly compressed materials, but also strange matter, which you must transport securely (you are lucky I'm just making it explode, following real physics it should break the universe at light speed).
Strange matter has a lot of unique properties like:
todo!

## Black hole (late-mid-game)
Black holes can give you insane quantities of energy, but it also helps you manipulate time !
You can also make turrets using them, storages, ...
You can make *Wormholes* which are a **fast** item transportation, they divide travel time by 10^10, but costs a lot of strange matter and energy to keep alive.
